I have some tasks for you to improve the dashboard:
1. The calculations doesn't seems to be correct for me for the different sections on the dashboard. Please evaluate all these with tests
2. The chart only has to show outcomes, not incomes.
3. The "Monatliche Einnahmen-Nutzung" section has to be accurate. That means:
3.1: all incomes and outcomes from the current month has to be applied to this calculation. The "Wiederkehrende Transaktionen" aswel, because I dont want to overspend money because I missed some  "Wiederkehrende Transaktionen" later this month.
3.2: The chart has to be more visual on what it shows. Change it more like a progressbar as an chart so the amount of income is 100% and the progress part is the outcome. The progress bar is red because of outcomes and the income part, the background of the progress bar is green. Apply the values anyway for better readability.
4. Make the "Wiederkehrende Transaktionen" callabsable like an accordion element.
5. The section "Sparübersicht is not working" Please validate and fix it. 
6. The Kontostand should be the first section on the dashboard.
